## Dataset

The Bank Churn Prediction dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer churn in a bank. It includes various columns containing valuable information about customers and their banking behavior.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features that can help analyze customer churn:

- **RowNumber**: A unique identifier for each row in the dataset.
- **CustomerId**: A unique identifier assigned to each customer, enabling individual customer analysis.
- **Surname**: The surname or last name of the customer.
- **CreditScore**: The credit score of each customer, reflecting their creditworthiness.
- **Geography**: The country or region where each customer is located.
- **Gender**: The gender of each customer.
- **Age**: The age of each customer in years.
- **Tenure**: The number of years each customer has been associated with the bank.
- **Balance**: The account balance of each customer.
- **NumOfProducts**: The number of bank products that each customer has.
- **HasCrCard**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for whether each customer possesses a credit card.
- **IsActiveMember**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for whether each customer is an active member.
- **EstimatedSalary**: The approximate salary of each customer.
- **Exited**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for whether each customer has churned (left the bank).

## Target Variable

The target variable for churn prediction is the **Exited** column. It indicates whether each customer has churned (1) or not (0). By using this target variable, you can develop machine learning models to predict customer attrition.

## Usage

To utilize this dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-churn-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to understand the data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps.
4. Modify the code or dataset as needed to adapt it to your specific use case.
5. Run the models and evaluate their performance on your own bank churn prediction tasks.
